# Mastering Data Science & Machine Learning

## Prelude

As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes ubiquitous, people will begin to rely more on the models for problem solving and critical thinking rather than using their own cognitive abilities. A few years ago, if you wanted to build and run a website, you had to have some working knowledge of domains, web servers, hosting, and web design (or at least website templates). If you came across a problem, and you most definitely did on your first try, you would first think about what to ask and how to ask it. You would question the problem, as best as you could, to Google and read the most related answer. You would then take this information and try applying it to the situation at hand, before another error would pop up, and you would repeat the cycle. This would go on and on, untill finally you had learnt something new about web development and the website functioned as intended. This process of back and forth was what helped novices and amateurs learn and become professionals.

This is no longer the case. Now, you simply tell ChatGPT (or Anthropic, if you're one of the cool kids) about what you want to do and it would spit out instructions on how to get it done. If there is any error in between, you don't need to read or understand it, but merely to copy and paste it into the chat terminal and the correct code would be regurgitated back. No thinking required; much less critical thinking.

I don't like that, and I don't want that. While many would claim that learning technical skills such as coding and data science has become redundant, and that there is no point in learning them, I don't feel the same. 1997 was thought to be a watershed moment for the chess community; why would someone want to learn the sport if no human can ever again be better than a machine? But did people stop learning the sport? Magnus Carlsen, the best chess player of our time, cannot beat a computer head to head in a chess match, but is that what we all value? Does that make him the same as the rest of us? Obviously not. The mastery of chess has given Mr. Carlsen, as it does for all those who learn it, an improved reasoning and critical thinking ability. In chess, the ability to win is contingent upon the player's ability to analyse all the possible games that can be played for the starting point, and to prospectively decide on which move to make. The strategy for a win is re-evaluated with each move of the opponent. To be the best chess player means to be able to process this large amount of information and make optimal decisions. A skill that gives them an advantage over the rest of us. Therefore, as players continue to learn chess, so too should the rest of us continue honing our own craft.

For me, this repository will serve as a journal of my journey toward mastering data science and machine learning, while for others it will act as, I hope, a useful roadmap.

I will keep this repository in chronological order so that progress can be easily reviewed in retrospect.

## Course outline
Between the two, data science, and machine learning, I find data science to be easier and a building block towards machine learning. Therefore, I will first work towards mastering the former before shifting towards the latter.

### Fundamentals of Data Science
There is a lot of information on the web about what you need to learn and how to learn it, if you want to become a data scientist. I initially thought about posting a few medium articles and YouTube road maps that I though were helpful in guidance. But since most of them gave the same instruction and for sake of keeping things simple, I decided to just list out the main topics, instead of sharing the links. Don't want to overwhelm anyone before they even start. I would note that, I will first focus on the key topics, the must haves, before going for the nice to haves.

1. SQL
2. Fundamentals of python
3. Key python libraries
4. Fundamentals of mathematics (statistics, probability) note: linear algebra, calculus will be covered in fundamentals of Machine Learning
5. DataVisualization (PowerBi and Python Library)

## SQL

There are many online courses and tutorials on learning SQL (paid and free). But given how basic the syntax for SQL is, the best way to master it is less focus on ___ courses and more on putting to partice what you have learnt. Because while the syntax is contstructing queries is what most people find challenging. Therefore, if you are a complete beginner, I would suggest watching the "SQL for Beginners"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA&t=290s] video by Programming with Mosh. It does a fantastic job at explaining how many of the key concepts.
